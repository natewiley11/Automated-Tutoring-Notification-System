# Automated-Tutoring-Notification-System
This project uses Python, Excel, and Twilio to automatically fetch tutoring appointment information and alert my cell phone 30 minutes before my appointments with the time and subject.

These programs will not work without a an additional python file named privateInfo.py that contains 6 functions not specified in the tutFunction.py program. The functions contain private information.
